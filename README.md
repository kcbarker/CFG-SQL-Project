# CFG-SQL-Project
This was a project created in MySQL and Tableau as part of the Code First Girls introduction to Data & SQL course. I was awarded the highly commended candidate award for my project. 

The project involved creating a database - I created an airline database. 

I also carried out the following as part of my project: 

* Creating views to pull the following information from the database easily:
  - flight details
  - those flights with higher than average prices
  - the most popular flights
  - the number of flights per destination
    
  The information above could be used to ascertain which flights and destinations are the most popular.

* Creating a stored procedure to show the number of flights per day - to show the most popular days for flying

* Creating a stored function to categorise the price as high, medium or low

* Creating a trigger so that customers making bookings must be over 18

* Creating a one time event to reduce prices by 10%

* Creating a stored function (with a sub-stored function) to determine whether a customer is a frequent flyer and therefore which are the most valued customers to the airline

* Creating visualisations in Tableau to show the most popular countries based on the bookings made and the top 10 destinations to show which are the most valuable routes to the airline.
